    "playerDescription" : "If there is one thing that separates Hardik Pandya from other young cricketers, it is his immense self-belief. The flamboyant Baroda all-rounder never lets pressure affect his game, but instead relishes such situations. A big hitter and a fast-bowling all-rounder, Hardik ticks all the boxes that a team desires from an all-rounder. It was no surprise that he was fast-tracked into the Indian ODI and T20 side after a successful run in the IPL 2015. In his debut IPL game against RCB, he hit a six off just the second ball he faced. However, his potential was truly known when he took Mumbai Indians to victory with a quick-fire eight ball 21 against CSK coming when the team needed 30 from two overs. Since then he has been a vital cog in the Mumbai Indians line-up. This year though he will be making his debut as captain for the new franchise Gujarat Titans. Hardik will be leading a side that boasts of a good blend of youth and experience. His credentials as an all-rounder are well known but how will he lead this new franchise? Only time will tell.",

    "playerDescription" : "A bowling all-rounder from South Africa, Chris Morris is a naturally gifted athlete, and can turn a game of cricket around with both bat and ball. Morris often bowls at speeds beyond 140kph and bats fearlessly in the lower order. With the ability to crank up the speed gun while generating good bounce, and some well-documented hitting prowess, he makes for a genuine all-round option.The 30-year-old Morris made his debut for the Delhi franchise in 2016 and finished as their leading wicket-taker in that season with 13 wickets. His destructive batting down the order has always come in handy as well. In his debut ODI series vs England in 2016, with South Africa 1-2 down and on the brink of losing the 4th ODI as well, Morris turned the match around from out of nowhere and stunned England with his power-hitting, scoring 62 off just 38 balls. A bowler capable of generating disconcerting pace and a batsman who can hit the ball hard, Morris has taken 55 wickets and scored 485 runs in the IPL.",

The 2021 edition of the league saw Maxwell amass 513 runs in 15 matches with a strike rate of 144.10. A destructive batsman, Glenn Maxwell has lit up the shortest format of the game with his batting exploits and power hitting. Maxwell is one cricketer who has always generated tremendous interest at the IPL auction. A brilliant fielder, who can contribute with his off-spin, the Australian can play the role of a floater in a line-up. His one of the best seasons was in 2014 when Maxwell teamed up with David Miller for Kings XI Punjab in clobbering the opposition and he now again returns to KXIP. The franchise went all out for him and could finally secure his services at a whopping INR 10.75 crore. Maxwell was released by Punjab Kings (then KXIP) ahead of the 2021 edition of the league and was then bought by RCB for a whooping INR 14.25 crores in the Player Auction.",

    "playerDescription" : "Captain Marvellous. Rohit Sharma has etched his name as the most successful captain in the IPL with five trophies, the most by anyone in the tournament. He has cracked the code and made MI the most consistent team. A prolific run-getter, the Hitman is one of the most naturally gifted batsmen in the world and has been enjoying a tremendous run with the bat. When it comes to the shorter format, there are few who can match his striking abilities. Rohit proved why he is regarded as a special talent when he became the first batsman to strike two double centuries in the ODIs and he now has three. He was one of the most consistent Deccan Chargers batsmen in the first three seasons of the IPL and was instrumental in his former franchise winning the crown in 2009 However, since 2011, Rohit has been an integral part of the Mumbai Indians guiding their batting line-up. He took over the team’s captaincy a couple of games into the 2013 season and led MI to their maiden IPL title. In the same year, MI also completed a grand double when they clinched the Champions League T20 title. His captaincy was put to test in the 2015 season after the team won just one of their first six games and were struggling to stay afloat. Mumbai Indians then staged a remarkable turnaround and lifted the Trophy for the second time with a convincing win in the final. Rohit, who made a half-century, was named the Player of the Match. The legacy of Hitman expanded further on, after powering Mumbai Indians to title victories in the 2017 and 2019 seasons, both being last ball thrillers. Rohit led the Mumbai Indians to a successful campaign in the 2020 season, which was their second consecutive title. MI did not qualify for playoffs in the 14th season and will be raring to go this time. He now returns as Team India’s full-time captain in all three formats of the game.",

From that day till now, nothing really has changed and Ishan’s stocks have only soared. The Mumbai Indians didn’t want to let him go and pulled out all stops as they spent a whopping 15.25 crore to have him back. It was the most expensive buy at the mega auction ahead of IPL 15. Now that Ishan returns home, the MI will count on him to carry on his aggressive approach and give the team the kind of starts required in the powerplay.",
